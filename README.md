lein-marginalia-plus
===================
A little fork of marginalia, that adds support for vertical layouts, along with some extra goodies.

Usage
=====

Assuming you have leiningen installed, add a dependency to your profile.clj for 
[lein-marginalia-plus "0.8.0-SNAPSHOT"] 
From the command line, a new lein command appears: margeplus 

lein margplus
lein margplus /path/to/source.clj 

The old lein marg command is still there for the parallel layout.
